Slow down. 
Spammers want you to act first and think later. If the message conveys a sense of urgency; never let their urgency influence your careful review.

Research the facts. 
Be suspicious of any unsolicited messages. If the email looks like it is from us, do your own research. Use a search engine verify our contact details.

Don’t let a link be in control of where you land. 
Hovering over links in email will show the actual URL at the bottom, but a good fake can still steer you wrong.

Delete any request for financial information or passwords. 
If you get asked to reply to a message with personal information, it’s a scam.
